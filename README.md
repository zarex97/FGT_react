- [ ] Complete Character Attributes (Array of Traits, True name, Concealed name, team color, Alignment)
- [ ] Add team color to players
- [ ] Add NP Logic (Should be easy, most of the Skill logic can be copied, same as what I did with Actions)
- [ ] Fix Profile Sheet
- [ ] Chat, to leave a record of the actions done and their results.
- [ ] Add a way to cancel Targeting with right click.
- [ ] Add daytime-night cycle logic and a visual indicator for it.
      Last Session Short term Goals:

- [ ] what about special duration for effects, like "3 times, 1 turn", or "For this combat process only", we must implement this.
- [ ] add something like combat but for effects, it would know all the properties of each effect and would get the resistances and other things to calculate if the effect was applied sucessfully
- [x] What about effects with triggers - related to passives..
  - [ ] They are halfway done, they just need some debugging.
