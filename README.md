- [ ] Implement fog of war
- [ ] Complete Character Attributes (Array of Traits, True name, Concealed name, team color, Alignment)
- [ ] Add team color to players
  - [x] Add Targeting Logic
    - [ ] "AOE_FROM_POINT" is like a bomb that explodes from the origin point selected and expands until it fills its full measures (like Morgana's tp attack, but most the attacks expand up until the constrains of range (like the Arjuna_berserker's Mahalapraya)). Add a new boolean like the "cornerRule" to this targeting logic or create another one "AOE_FROM_POINT_WITHIN_RANGE"
  - [x] Add Skill Logic
  - [ ] Add NP Logic (Should be easy, most of the Skill logic can be copied)
  - [ ] Add logic to differentiate normal skills from attack skills (or NPs, although most of these count as the attack of this turn)
- [x] Change how right button click works
