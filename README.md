- [ ] Complete Character Attributes (Array of Traits, True name, Concealed name, team color, Alignment)
- [ ] Add team color to players
- [ ] Add NP Logic (Should be easy, most of the Skill logic can be copied, same as what I did with Actions)
- [ ] Fix Profile Sheet
- [ ] Chat, to leave a record of the actions done and their results.
- [ ] Add a way to cancel Targeting with righ click.
- [ ] Add daytime-night cycle logic and a visual indicator for it.
      Last Session Short term Goals:

- [ ] what about special duration for effects, like "3 times, 1 turn", or "For this combat process only", we must implement this.
- [x] What about effects with triggers - related to passives..
  - [ ] They are halfway done, they just need some debugging.
