- [ ] Complete Character Attributes (Array of Traits, True name, Concealed name, team color, Alignment)
- [ ] Add team color to players
- [ ] Add NP Logic (Should be easy, most of the Skill logic can be copied, same as what I did with Actions)
- [ ] Fix Profile Sheet
- [ ] Add save/load function
  - [ ] Make that every "sendJsonMessage" that is sent to the server causes the game state to be saved in json file that will have an array of gameStates, up to a limit (e.g:100) 



Last Session Short term Goals:
- [ ] Finish logic of Actions (done, review chat (specially part about registry_character.js and registry.js))
- [ ] Complete UI for Actions
- [ ] Configurate important common Actions like "Evade"
