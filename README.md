- [ ] Complete Character Attributes (Array of Traits, True name, Concealed name, team color, Alignment)
- [ ] Add team color to players
- [ ] Add NP Logic (Should be easy, most of the Skill logic can be copied, same as what I did with Actions)
- [ ] Fix Profile Sheet

Last Session Short term Goals:

- [ ] what about special duration for effects, like "3 times, 1 turn", or "For this combat process only", we must implement this.
- [ ] What about effects with triggers - related to passives..
- [ ] Add save/load function
  - [ ] Make that every "sendJsonMessage" that is sent to the server causes the game state to be saved in a json file that will have an array of gameStates, up to a limit (e.g:100)
